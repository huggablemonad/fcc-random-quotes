Random Quote Machine
====================
An Elm-based solution to Free Code Camp's [Build a Random Quote
Machine](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-random-quote-machine)
front end development project. It uses [Plan
9](http://plan9.bell-labs.com/plan9/)'s `fortunes` as the source of its quotes.
The fortunes fall under the [Lucent Public License Version
1.02](LICENSE.lucent).
